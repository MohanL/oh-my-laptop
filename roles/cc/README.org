* clang

Clang is a new competitor for the pervasive, conventional gcc compiler. It
provides some awesome features such as [[http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html][expressive diagnostics]].

I highly recommend trying clang when you has some questions or problems with
your C/Object-C/C++ code.

To get clang on Debian/Ubuntu, just =sudo apt-get install clang=, however, if
you want clang on Mac OS X, you'd better to install [[https://developer.apple.com/xcode/][xcode]]. By the way, many
homebrew packages requires xcode(or its command line tools) as a dependency, so
I recommend you install xcode as soon as possible. Generally, you can get
stable xcode from App Store, and beta version xcode from apple's official
site.
